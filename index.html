<h1>OrangeSlice Teacher Rubric and Student Rubric</h1>
<!-- Overview -->
<p id="p1">Teacher Rubric and Student Rubric are excellent tools for rubric grading in the classroom.  This page briefly introduces the add-ons, states what permissions are requested and how they are used, details the privacy and security policies and lastly, the service terms.</p>

<!-- Teacher Rubric -->
<h2>Teacher Rubric</h2>
<h3>User Functionality Enhancements</h3>
<p id="p3">Easily and quickly make rubric selections and convert the Analysis or Holistic rubric into a percentage or points grade.
Teacher Rubric is an add-on that will increase your grading productivity and it professionally presents a scored rubric and grade for your students.</p>

<p id="p3">Google docs and Classroom are fantastic applications to create, distribute and receive submitted assignments from students.  However, the grading process seems to bring the efficiency to a screeching halt.   Where can the grade be placed so it stands out from the assignment?  How can rubric selections be made easily?  I like rubrics but the final grade can be tedious to calculate.  It takes too many highlights, clicks and time to format grades on 125 submissions.</p>

<p id="p3">OrangeSlice: Teacher Rubric increases the teacher’s grading productivity by eliminating repetitive clicks, presenting the rubric selections in an easy to use format and presenting the final grades in a consistent, professional format.  More time is created for the teacher to provide the needed constructive feedback their students need for success.</p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>
<h4>Video Summary</h4>
<p id="p4"><i>Google, the video begins with an email from GCP requesting the video be made.  This request was made for Student Rubric but was not made for Teacher Rubric.  Proactively, I made this video.  To introduce it, I used Student Rubric’s email request which explains why the client id in the email does not match Teacher Rubric’s.  However, the expected client id is shown when the scope access is requested.</i></p>

<!--p id="p5">This is TEACHER RUBRIC, Client ID:852746965799. <br>
STUDENT RUBRIC, Client ID:746159691031, IS BELOW!!!! </p-->

</p>

<h4>Documents Access</h4>
<!-- Access allows -->
<p id="p4">This scope request provides two functions for the user.  The first gives permission for the add-on to color in the rubric.  Both the Student and the Teacher benefit from this functionality.  The performance levels achieved per category are clearly identified.</p>

<p  id="p4">The permission also allows student feedback to be transcribed from the add-on to the doc.  The teacher can enter feedback for each category and can write an overall summary of the student’s work.  This provides an explanation of the performance levels reached by the student.  The teacher can also provide encouraging and constructive feedback to improve their future school work.</p>

<h4>Drive Access</h4>
<!-- Access allows -->
<p id="p4">This access allows the add-ons to rename the doc and provides access to the directory of files and folders within Google Drive.  The renamed doc and list of folders are used to decrease the teacher’s grading time and find assignments that are ready to be graded, quickly see the grades for a whole class and to identify students who have not turned in an assignment. </p>

<p  id="p4">
The add-ons will rename the doc after it has been self-reviewed, peer-reviewed, returned or graded.  The doc filename is modified to capture the review/graded status and includes the assignment’s grade.  This benefits the student and the teacher as the filename immediately informs the viewer as to the assignments status.  The teacher has an added benefit, managing assignment grading.  When the assignments are viewed in Google Drive, the teacher has a roster list of students and their graded status is clearly marked by the filename.  The teacher can select just those assignments that need to be graded.  For those having completed the assignment, the teacher has an alphabetized list of grades received.</p>

<h4>Script Container Access</h4>
<!-- Access allows -->
<p id="p4">This access allows the add-on to be added to your list of installed add-ons and allows the creation of a sidebar where the add-on is presented. From the menu, the add-on can be opened, the rubric can be processed with the scored grades and the add-on can be opened in different languages.</p>

<!-- Student Rubric -->
<h2>Student Rubric</h2>
<h3>User Functionality Enhancements</h3>
<p id="p3">This is the student version of Teacher Rubric.  Students are able to review their peer's work, make rubric selections and provide written feedback.  The complete bundle of feedback is then presented to the student with a professional appearance.</p>

<p id="p3">The peer's review becomes a permanent record on the student's assignment.  Once the teacher uses Teacher Rubric to make the final assessment, the peer's comments and rubric feedback are maintained.  This allows the student to see their progression from early on until the end.  In fact, the teacher can deepen the student's journey by doing a spot check, holistic review of the student's work.  At the conclusion of the assignment, there would be record of three reviews: a peer's review, a teacher's holistic review and finally the teacher's final grade.  This historical record can then be the starting point student reflections and teacher-student conversations on how to improve.</p>

<h4>Video Summary</h4>
<p id="p4"><i>Google, this add-on was created prior to GCP; hence it is housed within a doc.  Since the add-on is prevented from being opened from a doc, I am not able to show the expected client id during scope access request.  I copied the master doc and used it to create this video.</i></p>
